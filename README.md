Moo Monitor team, 

This project was made with Angular. This is an app for making a Single Page App, and is a huge upgrade from our very outdated previous system.

To "run" the app, run the command `ng serve -o` in the terminal. MAKE SURE THAT YOUR DEFAULT CMD IS COMMAND PROMPT.

Components are in folders that are equivalent to their name. For example, the `home` component.

Inside of those components are an `html` file, a `scss` file, a test file, and a `ts` or `typescript` file. 

The `html` file is the structure of the website

The `scss` file is almost identical to a `css` file, which is used for styling.

The test file probably won't be used.

The `typescript` file is a fancy version of Javascript and is used for any scripts that you would need for the corresponding component.

To create a new component, type `ng g c [name]`.
